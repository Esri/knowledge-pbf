# Compiling protobuf Definitions

The google protobuf repo provides precompiled binaries on their [release](https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/releases/) page. 

You can also download the protobuf source code and build the `protoc.exe` compiler following the instructions here: https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/tree/master/cmake#readme

Once you have generated the `protoc.exe` compiler, you can place it here in this `bin` folder and execute `build.ps1` from the repository root directory.
